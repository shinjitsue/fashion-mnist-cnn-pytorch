### Model Comparison Summary

| Model                          | Accuracy   | F1-Score   | Key Features             |
| ------------------------------ | ---------- | ---------- | ------------------------ |
| **CNN (No Augmentation)**      | **92.71%** | **0.9273** | Best overall performance |
| CNN (No Dropout)               | 90.80%     | 0.9072     | Strong generalization    |
| Main CNN (Aug + Dropout)       | 89.95%     | 0.8980     | Balanced approach        |
| Alternative CNN                | 88.31%     | 0.8822     | Simpler architecture     |
| Baseline (Logistic Regression) | 66.98%     | 0.6647     | Simple baseline          |

### Key Scientific Findings

1. **Data Augmentation Impact**: Surprisingly, the model without augmentation achieved the highest accuracy (92.71% vs 89.95%), suggesting that for Fashion-MNIST:

   - The dataset already contains sufficient variation
   - Aggressive augmentation may introduce noise rather than helpful diversity
   - This finding challenges conventional wisdom about always using data augmentation

2. **Regularization Trade-off**: The no-dropout model (90.80%) outperformed the model with dropout (89.95%), indicating:

   - The model capacity is well-suited for the dataset complexity
   - Dropout might be too aggressive for this particular architecture
   - The model shows good generalization without explicit regularization

3. **Architecture Effectiveness**: The main CNN consistently outperforms the alternative shallow architecture, validating the design decisions for deeper networks with batch normalization.

## 🏗️ Architecture Design

### Main CNN Architecture

```python
class FashionCNN(nn.Module):
    """
    3-layer CNN with batch normalization and dropout
    - Conv1: 1→32 channels, 3x3 kernel, BatchNorm, ReLU, MaxPool
    - Conv2: 32→64 channels, 3x3 kernel, BatchNorm, ReLU, MaxPool
    - Conv3: 64→128 channels, 3x3 kernel, BatchNorm, ReLU
    - FC1: 6272→256, ReLU, Dropout
    - FC2: 256→10 (output)
    """
```

### Architectural Decisions

1. **Kernel Size (3x3)**: Chosen for optimal balance between receptive field and parameter efficiency
2. **Channel Progression (32→64→128)**: Gradual increase allows learning hierarchical features
3. **Batch Normalization**: Stabilizes training and enables higher learning rates
4. **Dropout (0.25)**: Prevents overfitting in fully connected layers
5. **Two-stage Pooling**: Reduces spatial dimensions while preserving important features

### Alternative Architecture

- **Simpler design**: 2 convolutional layers with 5x5 kernels
- **Fewer parameters**: 16→32 channels for faster training
- **Comparison purpose**: Validates the benefit of deeper architectures

| ----------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Learning Rate** | 0.001             | Optimal balance between convergence speed and stability |
| **Batch Size**    | 64                | Memory-efficient while maintaining gradient quality     |
| **Epochs**        | 10                | Sufficient for convergence with early stopping          |
| **Optimizer**     | Adam              | Adaptive learning rates for faster convergence          |
| **Loss Function** | CrossEntropyLoss  | Standard for multi-class classification                 |
| **Scheduler**     | ReduceLROnPlateau | Adaptive learning rate reduction                        |

### Data Augmentation Techniques

1. **RandomRotation(10°)**: Handles slight orientation variations
2. **RandomHorizontalFlip(p=0.5)**: Increases dataset diversity
3. **RandomCrop(28, padding=4)**: Simulates position variations
4. **Normalization**: Mean=0.5, Std=0.5 for stable training
